## ✏️ Why I Built This

I created this portfolio to represent who I am — not just as a developer, but as a creative thinker who blends design, motion, and technology into meaningful digital experiences.

Building this portfolio helped me:
- Strengthen my understanding of frontend animations and performance using GSAP and Tailwind CSS.
- Learn to structure React applications.
- Express both my technical skills and creative vision through code.
